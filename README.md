# Divine Connect üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Snehamol K M's Team


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Snehamol K M - Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology


### Project Description
Divine Connect is a fun website where users can select their favorite deity, get their (totally fictional) contact number, and even chat with them using AI-generated divine responses.<br>
A light-hearted twist on religion and technology

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People worship for years hoping for a sign from God.<br>
But let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî where‚Äôs the contact info? Where‚Äôs the reply?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I built a website where:<br>
You can choose a god (e.g., Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha , Jesus , Allah).<br>
You'll get their ‚Äúcelestial‚Äù phone number.<br>
You can call them or start a chat with them.<br>
The gods reply instantly ‚Äî because they run on JavaScript.<br>
